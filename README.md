# Regex Redirect Extension

Create a simple extension that observes the current URL (using a MutationObserver). Then, if the mutated URL matches a regex pattern, redirect to another static URL mapped to that pattern.

- User can add a regex -> redirect mapping
- User can delete a regex -> redirect mapping
- User can toggle an individual redirect on & off
